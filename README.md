## Inputs

* `version` - REQIURED - Version of UUID to generate. Versions are 1, 3, 4, and 5.

> Note: Version 1 may pose a safety risk because it uses your network info.

* `namespace` - optional - namespace of the UUID. Can be DNS, URL, OID, or X500.

* `name` - optional - string that will be used to create the UUID.

## Outputs

* `uuid` - The generated UUID
* `safe` - The safeness of the UUID. `safe` means the UUID was generated by the platform in a multiprocessing-safe way, `unsafe` means the UUID was not generated in a multiprocessing-safe way, and `unknown` means the platform did not provide information on whether the UUID was generated safely or not.
